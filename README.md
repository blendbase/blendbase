# Overview

Blendbase provides single unified GraphQL API to access CRMs for SaaS solutions builders.
Instead of building and maintaining various integrations with third-party apps (e.g. Salesforce, HubSpot CRM, PipeDrive, etc.) you can use Blendbase CRM API to access all of them through a single unified interface regardless which CRM your users use. Blendbase also manages the complexity of authentication and authorization with CRMs.

## Supported CRMs

- Salesforce
- HubSpot

## Configuring Blendbase

1. Copy .env.sample `cp .env.sample .env`
2. Copy .env.sample `connect-fullstack-webapp-sample/.env.sample connect-fullstack-webapp-sample/.env`
3. Generate a secret used for encrypting sensitive information and store it in `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`: `go run main.go gen-enc-key`
4. Blendbase is using JWT tokens to authenticate both Omni and Connect APIs (both client side and server-side). Generate a secret that is going to be used for encrypting JWT tokens by running `openssl rand -hex 32` and store it in

- `BLENDBASE_AUTH_SECRET` in `~/.env.local`
- `BLENDBASE_AUTH_SECRET` in `~/connect-fullstack-webapp-sample/.env`

5. `docker-compose build`
6. `docker-compose up`
7. Go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the sample Connect app, follow the instructions below on configuring CRM integrations
8. Run `go run main.go gen-auth-token --consumer-id c6a82fd9-7e22-40c2-8bf2-db58a40839a9` to obtain an authentication token (the used consumer ID is preconfigured for test purposes)
9. Go to http://localhost:8080/ and configure HTTP headers (replace $token with the value from the previous step)

```
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer $token"
}
```

10. Test Omni API with the query

```
query {
  crm {
    contacts {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connecting to Salesforce

1. Login to your instances of Salesforce or create a new one at https://login.salesforce.com/ as an **admin**
2. Go to Settings > Setup > Apps > App Manager
3. Click on "New Connected App"
   1. Fill out the name and contact email
   2. Enable "Enable OAuth Settings"
   3. Fill out "Callback URL" with `https://example.com` - we will change it later
   4. In the "Selected OAuth Scopes" select:
      1. Manage user data via APIs (api)
      2. Perform Requests at any time (â€¦)
   5. Click "Save"
4. Set "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret" to h at http://localhost:3000/ (`SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID` and `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET` in .env for development and testing).

### Connecting to HubSpot

1. Log in to or create a new instance of HubSpot at https://app.hubspot.com/login as **admin**
2. Go to Settings (cog icon in the top-left)
3. Sidebar. Integrations > Private Apps.
4. Click "Create a private app"
5. Give it a name, e.g. "Blendbase app"
6. Switch to "Scopes" in the header and select:
   1. `crm.objects.companies` - Read & Write
   2. `crm.objects.contacts` - Read & Write
   3. `crm.objects.deals` - Read & Write
7. Click "Create app"
8. In app view page navigate to "Access token" section and copy the `Access token`, store it in "Integration Secret" at http://localhost:3000/ (`HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the .env file for development and tests).

## API

APIs:

- Connect API for managing your consumers and integrations with CRMs
- Omni API for interacting with CRM objects like contacts, notes, deals, etc.

API authentication is done via the Authorization header which should have a JWT token encoded with the value of the `BLENDBASE_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable. The JWT token should have the `cunsomer_id` claim that represents the current `Consumer` on behalf of whom CRM is being called. See [jwt.js](connect-fullstack-webapp-sample/utils/jwt.js) for an example.

# Development

### DB Setup

1. Set up Postgres database

```
createuser -d blendbase
createdb -O blendbase blendbase
```

2. Run `go run main.go db:migrate` to migrate the database
3. Run `go run main.go db:seed` to init DB with test data

### Running the server

1. `go run main.go server`
2. Go to http://localhost:8080/ to use GraphQL Playground
3. Execute the query

### GraphQL Generation

Blendbase is using `gqlgen` to generate the code based on the schema located at `/graph/schema.graphqls`.
After updating the schema make sure to run `go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate`

## Sample connect React application

Sample React connect app is used to demonstrate how blendbase can be integrated into a React app.

### Setup

1. `cd connect-fullstack-webapp-sample`
2. `cp .env.sample .env`
3. Make sure to assigned a value for `BLENDBASE_AUTH_SECRET` (see API Authentication section above)
4. `yarn install` - to install the dependencies
5. Run `curl http://localhost:3000/api/fetchConsumerID` in directory of the React app. That will call Blendbase API and will create and new consumer. Follow the instruction in the output of the API call.
6. `yarn run dev` - to run the app

## Testing

> make sure you have `.env.test` file in your root directory. You can copy .env.sample if you are doing this for the first time:

```shell
cp .env.sample .env.test
```

To run all the tests:

```shell
go test -v ./...
```

Run a specific file:

```shell
go test -v blendbase/connectors/salesforce
```

Disable cache:

```shell
go test -count 1 -v ...
```
